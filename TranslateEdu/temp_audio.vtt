00:00.000 --> 00:17.200
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore

00:17.200 --> 00:20.600
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money

00:20.600 --> 00:24.000
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills

00:24.000 --> 00:27.600
He has money at the ATM, he has money at the ATM

00:50.600 --> 00:58.200
I put all the guards on my tracks

00:58.200 --> 01:01.800
I put the mermaids, I put the mermaids

01:01.800 --> 01:05.600
I put the crew in the loop to take my tracks

01:05.600 --> 01:08.600
The day is coming, the day is coming

01:08.600 --> 01:12.600
It's a dangerous tractor, the body is small and beautiful

01:12.600 --> 01:16.600
Don't open your eyes, because the dogs are coming in

01:17.600 --> 01:22.600
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore

01:22.600 --> 01:26.600

01:46.600 --> 02:02.600
The moon is on alert, the siphons are blowing

02:02.600 --> 02:06.600
The siphons are blowing, the siphons are blowing

02:06.600 --> 02:09.600
I didn't lose and I don't have how to win a fight

02:09.600 --> 02:12.600
I'm fighting like a lion with the hyenas

02:12.600 --> 02:15.600
Dangerous intruders, small and beautiful bodies

02:15.600 --> 02:20.600
Don't open your eyes, because they are all in your pockets

02:21.600 --> 02:24.600
Since I started with gasoline I haven't been in the bar

02:24.600 --> 02:28.600

Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills
He has money at the ATM, he has money at the ATM
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills
He has money at the ATM, he has money at the ATM
I put all the guards on my tracks
I put the mermaids, I put the mermaids
I put the crew in the loop to take my tracks
The day is coming, the day is coming
It's a dangerous tractor, the body is small and beautiful
Don't open your eyes, because the dogs are coming in
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills
He has money at the ATM, he has money at the ATM
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills
The moon is on alert, the siphons are blowing
The siphons are blowing, the siphons are blowing
I didn't lose and I don't have how to win a fight
I'm fighting like a lion with the hyenas
Dangerous intruders, small and beautiful bodies
Don't open your eyes, because they are all in your pockets
Since I started with gasoline I haven't been in the bar
Gina, go to the bar with money, go to the bar with money
I go to the pub and I do all the dishes
She has money at the ATM, she has money at the ATM
Since I started with gasoline I haven't been in the bar
Gina, go to the bar with money, go to the bar with money
I go to the pub and I do all the dishes
She has money at the ATM, she has money at the ATM
Dangerous intruders, small and beautiful bodies
Don't open your eyes, because they are all in your pockets
Since I started with gasoline I haven't been in the bar
Gina, go to the bar with money, go to the bar with money
I go to the pub and I do all the dishes
She has money at the ATM, she has money at the ATM
Since I started with gasoline I haven't been in the bar
Gina, go to the bar with money, go to the bar with money
I go to the pub and I do all the dishes
She has money at the ATM, she has money at the ATM
Thank you for watching!

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,600
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,000
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,600
He has money at the ATM, he has money at the ATM

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,000
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,400
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,800
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,400
He has money at the ATM, he has money at the ATM

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,200
I put all the guards on my tracks

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,800
I put the mermaids, I put the mermaids

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,600
I put the crew in the loop to take my tracks

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
The day is coming, the day is coming

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,600
It's a dangerous tractor, the body is small and beautiful

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Don't open your eyes, because the dogs are coming in

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,600
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
He has money at the ATM, he has money at the ATM

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Since I was a kid, I didn't care about money anymore

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I go out with a lot of money, I go out with a lot of money

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I go to the bank to steal, and I break all my bills

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:02:02,600
The moon is on alert, the siphons are blowing

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
The siphons are blowing, the siphons are blowing

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I didn't lose and I don't have how to win a fight

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm fighting like a lion with the hyenas

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Dangerous intruders, small and beautiful bodies

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Don't open your eyes, because they are all in your pockets

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Since I started with gasoline I haven't been in the bar

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Gina, go to the bar with money, go to the bar with money

30
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I go to the pub and I do all the dishes

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
She has money at the ATM, she has money at the ATM

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Don't open your eyes, because they are all in your pockets

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
